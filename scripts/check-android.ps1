# Checks the Android app's release build against LICENSING.md and its budgets:
#  * every library in the store release (:app's storeReleaseRuntimeClasspath) comes
#    from an allowed group, so no FFmpeg, mpv or GPL artifact slips in (the apps
#    contain no FFmpeg and no GPL code);
#  * the release APK has no native code (lib/**.so) but the two small libraries
#    AndroidX brings, built for every ABI: pley's own code has none, so it runs
#    on Fire TV's 32-bit userspace;
#  * the release APK is at most 12 MB.
# Run after `gradlew assembleStoreRelease` in apps/android (CI does both). The size
# goes to the job summary on GitHub Actions. Exit code 1 on violations.
